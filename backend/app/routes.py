"""Every URL the frontend can call.

Fahim owns this file. Each slice adds one or two more functions here, and the
shape never changes:

    @router.get("/some-url")     <- which URL, and which HTTP verb
    def some_name():             <- a completely normal Python function
        return {"hello": "world"} <- whatever you return becomes JSON

That is the whole idea. A route reads the request, does a small amount of
work (or asks another file to do it), and returns something.

Keep routes short. When a route starts doing real thinking — chunking text,
comparing numbers, calling the model — that logic belongs in its own file and
the route just calls it. It keeps this file readable and makes the logic
testable without starting a server.
